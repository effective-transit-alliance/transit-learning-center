# Network Design Principles

The service on the New York regional rail network should appeal to as many people for as many different types of trips as possible.
The offering needs to be predictable and easy to use.
Trains must run frequently, defined here as headways no greater than 10 minutes wherever infrastructure allows, so that riders can just show up and go.

## Resilience in the face of a changing world

Emerging ridership trends show that ridership has recovered best on off-peak trains.
With the future of five-day-a-week-in-office work very much in doubt, it is crucial that the LIRR broaden its conception of the riders and trips it serves.
To do otherwise would both perform a disservice to greater New York residents and imperil the organization's own future.
Moreover, the changes that the railroads would have to make to its operating pattern would facilitate more straightforward crew scheduling.
Today's peak-heavy service requires many staff to work in the morning, rest during the midday, and come back on duty in the evening.
This practice, known as a split shift, costs more per service hour than planning crews to work a continuous day.
Added off-peak service would also amortize the capital costs of trains and infrastructure across more paying riders.

## Show up and go with clockface scheduling

Trains should run frequently all day every day well into the night.
Riders should be able to expect a train to arrive within minimal wait time on the platform and not need to consult a schedule.
In line with peer operations in the rest of the world, the LIRR's off-peak frequency should never drop below half that of the peak, and ideally the same frequency should be maintained all day while varying train lengths as necessary.

Moreover, the trains should come at the same times after the hour at a consistent interval, which is a practice known as **clockface scheduling**.
While the proposed plan makes progress in this area, several lines' proposed schedules still contain alternating headways, for example 22 and 38 minutes after the hour.
Many trains deviate from a true clockface schedule by a few minutes, forcing riders to check the timetables so they do not miss their train.
Schedules should be modified to create clockface schedules, for example, at 22 and 52 minutes per hour, wherever possible.

## Legible routes

Outside major hubs, lines should have as few stopping patterns as possible so that riders can reach intermediate stations as easily as the main ones.
Riders walking up to intermediate stations should be able to grab the first train in the right direction without worrying where it will go.
Local trains should make all the stops.
Express trains, when they exist at all, should also not make varying stopping patterns.

Inbound trains from a single branch should always head to the same hub.
The current service proposal would split trains on each branch between Grand Central and Penn Station, a practice often termed **reverse branching**.
Dedicating each branch to a single hub not only reduces complexity for riders, but it also reduces the amount of merges at junctions, improving reliability.

## Embracing transfers

It is infeasible to give everyone a one-seat ride to everywhere they may want to go.
Historically, greater New York commuter rail service has tried to maximize one-seat rides and express service between Manhattan and outlying communities.
However, this requires complex service patterns and inconveniences Queens and inner Nassau riders or those not traveling to or from the urban core.
A few more one-seat rides were made possible at the cost of the great majority of possible trips.

Modern regional rail prioritizes all of the aforementioned principles and avails itself of modern trains' aggressive acceleration and braking rates so that trains make as many stops as possible.
Whether transfers are **timed**, such that trains from different branches arrive simultaneously or nearly so, or **untimed** such the timing of pairs of trains are uncorrelated but both are frequent, riders can always transfer with minimal added wait time, whenever they arrive at the station.
